# Pokedex

An assignment turned into a hobby project.

I use this React app to practice working with third party APIs, in this case the Pok√©API. The Pokedex project also utilizes React Router to move in-between pages.

New features are continually added whenever I have the time to play around with it :)

A complete visual overhaul is in the works, making the next step adding TailwindCSS to make the app look a LOT better.
